        Umm al Quwain History
        <p class="hispara">

            The Emirate of Umm Al Quwain holds significant archaeological interest, with major finds at both Tell Abraq
            and Ed-Dur pointing to significant Ancient Near Eastern Cities. Arrowheads and other polished flint tools
            have been unearthed in various sites across the UAE while pieces of Ubaid Age pottery have been unearthed
            along the shores of the emirate. All evidence obtained so far indicate that contact with Mesopotamia existed
            as early as the 5th millennium BC, as an indigenous ceramic industry, did not emerge until the 3rd century
            BC.
            Finds at both Tell Abraq and Ed-Dur show habitation in the area throughout the Bronze Age, from the Hafit
            period, through the Umm Al Nar period and the later Wadi Suq and Iron I, II and III ages. Finds also link
            Ed-Dur with the inland settlement of Mleiha, especially distinctive burials of animals with their heads
            turned back on their bodies. Significant trading links with both the western Sumerian culture and the
            eastern Indus Valley culture are displayed at these sites, with the semi-nomadic Magan people smelting
            bronze mined in the Hajar Mountains and then shipping the smelted ore.
            Macedonian coinage unearthed at Ed-Dur dates back to Alexander the Great, while hundreds of coins have been
            found bearing the name of Abi'el. In March 2019, 15 tombs, bronze statues, settlement remains, jewellery and
            pottery, dating back to the 1st century CE, were unearthed here. It is thought Ed-Dur is the site of Omana,
            mentioned by both Pliny and Strabo as an important town in the Lower Persian Gulf.
