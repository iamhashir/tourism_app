       Ras Al Khaimah History
        <p class="hispara">
            The northern area of the city today known as Ras Al Khaimah was previously the location of the important
            Islamic era settlement and port of Julfar. Ras Al Khaimah has been the site of continuous human habitation
            for 7,000 years, one of the few places in the country and the world where this is the case.
            Archaeological evidence has demonstrated that the settlement known as Julfar shifted location over time as
            harbour channels silted up. Excavations of a sizable tell, which revealed remnants of a Sassanid era
            fortification, indicate that early Julfar was located in the north of the present city of Ras Al Khaimah,
            not far from other sites of historical and archaeological interest such as the Pre-Islamic fort, 'Sheba's
            Palace' (Shimal Fort).
            One of Ras Al Khaimah's most celebrated sons, Ibn Majid, was a hugely influential seaman, navigator and
            cartographer, and there is evidence in his writing that the town he came from was at that time known as Ras
            Al Khaimah, that town having eclipsed Julfar as the principal port and settlement of the Shimal coast.
            In the early 18th century, the Qawasim (singular Al Qasimi) established themselves in Ras Al Khaimah and
            Sharjah on the Arabian Peninsula, growing to become a significant maritime force with holdings on both the
            Persian and Arabian coasts that frequently came into conflict with British flagged shipping.
            In the aftermath of a series of attacks against shipping sailing under Omani flags and following 1809
            monsoon season, the British mounted the Persian Gulf campaign of 1809 against Ras Al Khaimah, in which the
            Al Qasimi fleet was largely destroyed. The British operation continued to Lingeh on the Persian coast which
            was, like the Greater and Lesser Tunbs islands, administered by the Al Qasimi.
            By the morning of 14 November, the military expedition was over and the British forces returned to their
            ships, having suffered light casualties of five killed and 34 wounded. Arab losses are unknown, but were
            probably significant, while the damage done to the Al Qasimi fleets was severe: a significant portion of
            their vessels had been destroyed.
